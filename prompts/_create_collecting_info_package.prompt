## Collecting Information

Next, collect remaining information from the user, one question at a time.

The information you need to collect includes, but might not be limited to:

- Whether this package is mean to be a pure Dart package or a Dart package which is used only with Flutter.
- If there are ambiguous elements to the design, ask the user questions to clarify. When the goal is clear, or the user says to, then move on.
- If the user didn't already give one, select a short descriptive name for the package.
- Whether to do the work on the current git branch, or a new feature branch.
  - Suggest a branch name, making sure it is a valid git branch name.
- Which directory to use as the package directory. Suggest a location.

If the user wants the work done on a new branch, create the branch now.
Then create the package directory, if it doesn't already exist.

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Change directories to the package directory now so that future operations are relative to that directory.
