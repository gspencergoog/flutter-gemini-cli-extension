The implementation plan should specify after each phase that you should:

- [ ] Create/modify unit tests for testing the code added or modified in this phase, if relevant.
- [ ] Run the dart_fix tool to clean up the code.
- [ ] Run the analyze_files tool one more time and fix any issues.
- [ ] Run any tests to make sure they all pass.
- [ ] Run dart_format to make sure that the formatting is correct.
- [ ] Re-read the {{metadata.implementation_doc}} file to see what, if anything, has changed in the implementation plan, and if it has changed, take care of anything the changes imply.
- [ ] Update the {{metadata.implementation_doc}} file with the current state, including any learnings, surprises, or deviations in the Journal section. Check off any checkboxes of items that have been completed.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify the changes that have been made, and create a suitable commit message for any changes, following any guidelines you have about commit messages. Be sure to properly escape dollar signs and backticks, and present the change message to the user for approval.
- [ ] Wait for approval. Don't commit the changes or move on to the next phase of implementation until the user approves the commit.
