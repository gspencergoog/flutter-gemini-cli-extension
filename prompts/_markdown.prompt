## Markdown Document Format

When writing Markdown for this project, use the following format:

````md
# 1. Main Section Head

## 1.2 Secondary Section Head

Unordered lists use dashes:

- Unordered list item 1.
- Unordered list item 2.

Ordered lists have only one space after the number.

1. Ordered list item 1.
   a. Ordered list item 1.a.
   b. Ordered list item 1.b.
2. Ordered list item 2.

   Blocks that are part of a list item are indented to the beginning of the list item text.

   ```code
    // code block that is part of Ordered list item 2.
    // There are blank lines before and after code block.
   ```

Fenced blocks always include a language specifier, even if it is "txt".

```txt
my_project/
├── lib/
└── DESIGN.md
```

Don't end headings with a colon.

- **Bold Items**: Place any colons outside of the bold asterisks when prefacing text.
